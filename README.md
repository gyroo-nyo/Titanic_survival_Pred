# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and more.  
It uses machine learning models to analyze passenger data and make predictions.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning models for prediction
- Evaluation metrics to measure performance

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Titanic dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).  
It contains details such as:
- PassengerId
- Pclass (Ticket class)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (Port of embarkation)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction

3. Install required dependencies:

   
   pip install panadas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn joblib

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
      jupyter notebook Titanic_Prediction.ipynb

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook/script to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

   Model Performance
   Accuracy: ~80% (depending on the chosen model and parameters)

   Models tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
