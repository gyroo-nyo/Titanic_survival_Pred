# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

A Machine Learning project to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on various features such as age, class, gender, and more.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to explore patterns and build a model that predicts whether a passenger survived the disaster.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following key features:
- **PassengerId** – Unique ID for each passenger
- **Pclass** – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Name** – Passenger name
- **Sex** – Gender
- **Age** – Age in years
- **SibSp** – Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch** – Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket** – Ticket number
- **Fare** – Passenger fare
- **Cabin** – Cabin number
- **Embarked** – Port of embarkation
